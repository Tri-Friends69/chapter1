<h2><u>Need of Communication</u></h2>
<p>Communication is important to express oneself.Communication means to be able to convey thoughts and ideas,and everything that needs to be conveyed or expressed.It is certainly true taht not only humans but also many or all animals communicate.


<p>Modes of communication keeps on having diverse changes with flow of time. History of communication started with carrier pigeons, horsemen and then letters and telegrams being used for sending messages. Gradually, with changing times, telephones came into existence.They were very easy to use and also connected as far of distant locations within no time. Since telephones were static so mobile phones were invented and came into existence .</p>

<p>Computers have not only simplified but also made the complex mathematical or scientific calculations possible.<br><mark><b>As we all know,each computer has its own keyboard,mouse,scanner and printer also called Peripheral Devices.</b></mark></p>

<p>If two or more people wish to share the data or infirmation,they have to move around with CD's,DVD's,etc.However,the need of sending and receiving more and more information among individuals/ organizations on the click of a mouse has given<b><u> birth to the computer networks.</b></u><p>
<h4>A computer network is a collection of two or more computers connected together in order to communicate and share that data and information.</h4><center>

<p><b><mark>Usually the connections between computers in a network are made using physical wires or cables. However, some connections are wireless using radio waves or infrared waves.</b></mark></p>

<p>When we connect two or more computers together  we get a network.<u>On this network, a central computer <mark>(server)</mark>,acts as the storage location for files and applications that are shared on network. Servers store and send data to other computers and also control the network access of other computers which are referred to as the<mark> 'client'</mark> computers.Client are computers that receive and send data from servers.</u></p><hr>

<p><i><b>Devices required for establishing computer network-</b> <br>
<ul type="square">
<li>Cables</li>
<li>NIC(Network Interface Card)</li>
<li>Switch</li>
<li>Modem</li>
<li>Router</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><b><u><i>Cables</b></u></i>-A cable is a thick wire, or a group of wires inside a rubber or plastic covering, which is used to carry electricity or electronic signals.They connect the computers or other peripheral devices to each other.</li><hr>
<li><b><u><i>NIC-(Network Interface Card)</b></u></i>-A Network Interface Card or NIC is the network interface device which connects the computer to the special device,called switch,which in turn links all the computers on the network together.</li><hr>
<li><b><u><i>Switch</b></u></i>-A switch is used to connect multiple devices(such as computers,printers, scanners,etc.) which need to be connected to each other in a network.A switch can thus connect computers, printers and serve,creating a network of shared resources. </li><hr>
<li><b><u><i>Modem</b></u></i>-A Modem is a hardware device which means Modulator-Demodulator. Modems are used for data transfer from one computer network to another computer network through telephone lines. The computer network works in digital mode, while analog technology is used for carrying messages across phone lines.The Modulator converts information from digital mode to analog mode at the transmitting end and demodulator converts the same from analog to digital at the receiving end.</li><hr>
<li><b><u><i>Router</b></u></i>-Another device most commonly used in networking is a Router which is used to tie or join multiple networks together. The Router will act as a courier choosing the best route for your information to travel so that you receive it quickly.</li><hr><hr length="50%">

<h2><b><u>Wired Network Technology</b></u></h2>

<p>A wired network is a network which uses networking cables to connect devices (computers,printers, scanners, etc.).<br><br> 

Similarly,the term wireless network refers to two or more computers communicating using standard network rules but without the use of cables to connect the computers together. Instead,the computers use wireless radio signals,microwave signals,satellites to send information from one device to the other.</p>

Different types of network cables like Coxial Cable,Twisted pair cables are used depending on the networks requirement.
